# React MUD

This is an app to practice the incorporation of Socket.io into a React/Redux framework. The user will be able to log in, create a character with a password, which will be securely stored as a hash, then move from room to room and interact with the game world through a series of predefined commands. If they already have a character, they will be able to log back in with that character.
